## What are Propositions?

- It is a declarative sentence, with complete logical meaning, which can have only one of two values (True or False).
- It needs to have a clear and complete meaning.
- Examples
	- 2+4=4.
	- BH is the capital of Minas Gerais.
	- Exists life in another planets.
	- There is life on other planets.

## Principles of Logic

1. Principle of identity
	- A true proposition is true, and a false proposition is false.
2. Principle of non-contradiction
	- No proposition can be both true and false at the same time.
3. Principle of excluded middle
	- Every proposition must be either true or false. There is no third option.

## Representing Propositions

- Letters are usually used to represent propositions. Ex.: P, Q, R, S, T, etc.
- They can be uppercase or lowercase.
- Examples:
	- P: 2+4=6
	- Q: John's house is yellow.
	- R: An even number is divisible by 2.

## What is and what is not a Proposition

- Propositions need to have complete meaning.
	- Ex.: My room is beautiful. (correct)
	- Ex.: Beautiful room. (incorrect)
- Nominal phrases are **NOT** propositions.
	- Ex.: The big grey elephant. (It is not a proposition. There is no verb in this sentence.)
- Exclamatory sentences are **NOT** propositions.
	- Ex.: Long live Brazil!
- Interrogative sentences are **NOT** propositions.
	- Ex.: What day is it today?
	- Ex.: How old are you?
- Imperative sentences are **NOT** propositions.
	- Ex.: Help me.
	- Ex.: Burn the old papers.
- Sentences without a specific subject are **NOT** propositions.
	- Ex.: That person was seen at the crime scene.
	- Ex.: He is my friend.
- Open sentences are **NOT** propositions.
	- Ex.: x+2=5.
- Sentences that are a contradiction of themselves are **NOT** propositions.
	- Ex.: This statement is false.
