## Simple Propositions

Simple propositions do not have any other proposition as an integral part of themselves, that is, they cannot be divided into smaller propositions.

- Ex.: 2+2=5.
- Ex.: The earth is blue.
- Ex.: Every man is mortal.

## Compound Propositions

Compound propositions are formed by two or more simple propositions linked by logical connectives (also called logical operators).

- Ex.: John is a teacher **AND** Maria is a doctor.
- Ex.: I'm going to the market to buy oranges **OR** I'm going to the pharmacy to buy medicine.
